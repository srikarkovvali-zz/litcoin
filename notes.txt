Section 7 - Lecture 34
Notes on Cryptocurrency Implementation

We'll start writing the code for a few new concepts. The first of which is digital wallets
We shortly discussed this in the introduction.

Wallet - The wallet is the core object of the currency with 3 main components:
    1. Balance - Total balance alloted to an individual.
    2. Keys - Private and Public Keys which are vital for generating unique digital signatures, and the public
              Key is used to verify the signatures.
    3. Public Address - Identical to the public key. Used to send currency to the wallet.

Transactions - Consist of 2 components:
    1. Details about the original sender: (Input, Balance, Public Key)
    2. Output Object - Amount and address field. (senders c.balance - amount out)

 Digital Signature - Each individual who wants to record a transaction must stamp the transaction with his keys.


Transaction Pool - Lecture 44

An object that contains all new transaction submitted by individuals. Miners do the job of creating blcks
that confirm the transactions. While transaction objects can be created instantly, there will be a brief period where it
is unconfirmed until a miner confirms it.

Miners of Transactions

THe primary role of the miner is to take tranactions rom the pool, do the computational wotk and storing
them in the blockchain.

What is their incentive?
This leads us to the concept of rewards: transaction that uses currency as payment
Miners can rack up these rewards and build up the wealth. These transactions got from unconfirmed to confirmed.

The Nuance of Wallet Balance

    - The balance is the output amounts that belong to a user
    - Update the balance at least before each transaction
    - All output's since the user's most recent transaction.
    - It is possible double counting of transactions within the blockchain history.

Say user foo wants to send 50 to Bar.
